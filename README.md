  - Questions on Logistic Regression

    - Is logistic regression a method for classification or regression?

    - How many classes (or levels) does the response variable have in a logistic regression model?

    - Does the slope(s) in logistic regression have the same interpretation as slope(s) in linear regression?

    - In fitting a logistic regression, how to generate predictions based on the fitted model?

  - Question on LDA-QDA

    - What are the assumptions in LDA? Does logistic regression have such assumptions?
    - What is the relationship of LDA and Bayes classifier?
    - What are the suitable situations of LDA vs. logistic regression? (Differences)
    - What are the suitable situations of LDA vs. QDA?
    - Which approach is better: LDA or QDA?

  - Questions on KNN

    - Is KNN a parametric method or nonparametric method?
    - What is the shape of decision boundary of KNN?
    - When K increases, does the flexibility of KNN increase or decrease?
    - How to find the optimal value of K in applying KNN?

  - Comparison between KNN LDA QDA

    - What is the shape of decision boundary for each classifier?
    - When a linear boundary works for the data, should we choose LDA or logistic regression?
    - When a linear boundary does not work, should we choose QDA or KNN?
